## Objective

The purpose of this activity is to allow students to apply data concepts in a distributed database environment. They must design a system that is scalable and efficiently partitioned to handle a large volume of data.

## Scenario and initial requirements

  * Imagine you are designing an inventory management system for a supermarket chain that has branches in different cities.
  * Each branch has a large volume of products in its stock;
  * The system needs to be able to handle millions of product records;
  * Stock query and inventory updates must be quick and efficient;
  * System scalability is essential as new branches may be added in the future.

## Challenges to be accomplished

  * Design the data partitioning strategy, consider aspects such as horizontal, vertical or fragmentation partitioning.
  * Justify your choices based on scalability and performance requirements.
  * The group may choose a different approach, but must present solid arguments for their decisions.
  * Carry out a simulation of the implementation of the idealized partitioning strategy using freely chosen tools.
  * Participants must generate a simulated data set to represent products in various branches.
  * Conduct performance tests to evaluate the effectiveness of your partitioning strategy.
  * Include inventory query scenarios, inventory updates and addition of new branches.
  * Submit a report describing your approach, performance test results, and any recommended adjustments.
